# BeamPlastic

This plugin implements a co-rotational elasto-plastic model using the Timoshenko beam theory. The plastic model used is a Von Mises-Hill plastic model with mixed work hardening (isotropic and kinematic), adapted to the representation of metal alloys. Plastic resolution is performed using a radial feedback algorithm.

This plugin originates from the pull-request [#1618](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1618) on the SOFA repository.
